      <h4>Technical Crash Investigation</h4>
      <h5 class="attention-n">40 HOURS</h5>
      <p class="crs-date attention">November 14-18, 2022</p>
      <p class="crs-location">NLETC</p>
      <p class="crs-desc">A 40 hour course with where the applied physics of vehicle dynamics will be explored at a deeper level. The students will learn to do vehicle speed determinations using linear momentum solutions and will further build the student's abilities with time/distance calculations and applications. This course will prepare the student to move on to the Reconstruction Course but will also allow to the student to be a proficient on-scene technical investigator to support Reconstructionists in their agencies or regions. It will prepare them to move on to the Crash Reconstruction curriculum.</p>

      <h4>Traffic Crash Reconstruction</h4>
      <h5 class="attention">2023</h5>
      <p class="crs-date">80 HOURS</p>
      <p class="crs-location">NLETC</p>
      <p class="crs-desc">This is an 80-hour course. Early application for this course is encouraged. Prior to the start of the class, study the materials you received in Intermediate, Advanced, and Technical Crash Investigations; particularly with regard to basic mathematics and algebra. This course is the fourth and final piece in the NLETC crash investigation curriculum. The students will be instructed in specialized applications of momentum as well as completing real-world projects to emphasize all aspects of these courses from Intermediate on up. Further blocks on technology, courtroom considerations, report writing and human factors will round-out the course so that the student has a complete picture of many of the aspects of the crash reconstruction process. Introductions to specialized courses in specific vehicle and crash types (ie. motorcycles, bicycles, commercial vehicles, rollovers, pedestrians, etc) will be given so that the investigator is aware of further courses to expand their knowledge in this ever-evolving field.</p>
